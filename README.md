# Air

The **"Air"** landing page is a **responsive** website for a strategic agency, designed with **HTML/SCSS** using **BEM methodology**. The layout includes a logo and navigation bar at the top, followed by a title section with a slider. Key sections like "About," "Our Experience" (featuring three points), and "Services" provide insight into the agency's offerings. The testimonials section showcases feedback from three clients. The footer features a contact form for name, email, and message, along with essential contact information including phone number, address, and social media links.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game board, buttons, and messages. It defines the basic layout of the game grid and elements like the score display, win/loss messages, and the start/restart button.
- **SCSS**: Used for styling the game’s UI, giving it a visually appealing look. SCSS offers more flexibility than standard CSS, allowing the use of variables, nesting, and mixins to maintain a clean and manageable stylesheet. It controls the appearance of grid cells, colors, animations, and dynamic class changes based on the game’s state (e.g., changing styles as tiles merge).
